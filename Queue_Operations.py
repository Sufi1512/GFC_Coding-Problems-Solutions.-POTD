The given problem involves performing queue operations and finding the frequency of elements in the queue. We are provided with two functions: `insert` and `findFrequency`.

The `insert` function is responsible for inserting elements into the queue. It takes two parameters: `q`, which represents the queue, and `k`, the element to be inserted. The function appends the element `k` to the queue.

The `findFrequency` function is used to find the frequency of a given element in the queue. It also takes two parameters: `q`, the queue, and `k`, the element whose frequency needs to be determined. The function utilizes the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each element in the queue. It then returns the frequency of the element `k` by accessing `frequency[k]`.

Both functions can be called multiple times from the `main` function. The `insert` function will be called N times to insert elements into the queue, and the `findFrequency` function will be called M times to find the frequency of different elements in the queue.

It's important to note that the queue `q` is represented as a list in the code, and the elements are inserted and accessed using list operations.


CODE:
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    # Function to insert element into the queue
    def insert(self, q, k):
        q.append(k)
    
    # Function to find frequency of an element
    # Return the frequency of k
    def findFrequency(self, q, k):
        frequency = Counter(q)
        return frequency[k]
